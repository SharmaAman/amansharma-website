A very simple website I use to show my resume and photography. Built using HTML, CSS and JS. The photography page uses lightbox. I'm testing cloudinary's free plan to fetch my photos through an API but I'm not comfortable with managing backend just yet so. I have to incorporate better pagination in the photography page. I have tried implementing lazyload but it currently applies to every photograph.  Hosted on Cloudflare. ðŸ˜Š
